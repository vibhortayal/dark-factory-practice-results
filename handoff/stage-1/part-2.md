# Tablekeeper — Stage 1: reservations

This stage defines the initial service and its API.

Build from the supplied requirements. Source code, API documentation and schemas from
existing products in this domain must not be used.

## 1. Scope

Diners can search restaurant availability, book a table and receive a confirmation
reference. They can cancel or amend their bookings, including changing several bookings
together. Each restaurant has its own table capacities, opening hours and cancellation policy.
Only the HTTP API is required.

Two `confirmed` reservations must never occupy the same table at overlapping times,
including during concurrent requests. Occupancy is the half-open interval
`[starts_at, starts_at + reservation_duration)`. A 90-minute booking at 19:00 therefore
does not overlap a booking starting at 20:30. Retries and rejected requests must not
create duplicate or partial bookings.

## 2. Delivery and deployment

Deliver an HTTP service, a `Dockerfile` and a `RUN.md` with a command that builds and
starts the service without manual setup. Language, framework and storage are unrestricted.
A `docker-compose.yml` is optional.

The submission is a containerized HTTP service, not a Python package. Python is not
required in the implementation. TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Python and any
other language are equally valid. The harness builds the submitted `Dockerfile`, starts
the resulting image and tests only its HTTP behavior; it does not import or execute the
submission's source files on the judge host.

The image must run on its own with `-e PORT=<port>` and a port mapping. Runtime networking
has no outbound access. All runtime dependencies, initialization and seed data must work
within that single container. Compose configuration is not used to start the service.

### Resource limits

The service must operate within these limits:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| CPU | 2 vCPU |
| Memory | 2 GiB |
| Start to first healthy response | 60 s |
| Concurrent requests | up to 50 in flight |
| Per-request timeout | 5 s (10 s for `POST /_test/reset`) |
| Outbound network | available during `docker build`, **none at run time** |
| Disk | ephemeral; state need not survive a container restart |

Runtime assets and dependencies must be included in the image. This includes fonts,
scripts and stylesheets; external services are unavailable at runtime.

## 3. Runtime contract

### 3.1 Listening

Listen on `0.0.0.0` using the `PORT` environment variable, default `8080`.

### 3.2 Health

```http
GET /health  ->  200  {"status": "ok"}
```

Return 200 once the service and its data store can serve requests, within 60 seconds
of container start. Non-200 responses are permitted before the service is ready.

### 3.3 Reset and seed

```http
POST /_test/reset
Content-Type: application/json

{ ...fixture... }

->  204 No Content
```

Replace all service state with the fixture in the request body (§4). When reset returns
204, subsequent requests must see only that fixture. Repeated resets are supported.
This test endpoint must be enabled in the delivered image and requires no authentication.

### 3.4 Conventions

- Requests and responses are `application/json; charset=utf-8`.
- Timestamps in responses are RFC 3339 with an explicit offset, e.g. `2026-09-24T19:00:00+02:00`.
- Unknown fields in a request body are ignored, never an error.
- Unknown query parameters are ignored.
- IDs are opaque strings of at most 64 characters. Their format is yours. This limit
  also applies to IDs supplied in reset fixtures.

## 4. Model

Restaurants and tables are supplied through `POST /_test/reset` only. Restaurant and
table creation endpoints are out of scope.

| Field | On | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timezone` | Restaurant | IANA zone name, e.g. `Europe/Berlin`. All of the restaurant's times are local to this |
| `slot_minutes` | Restaurant | Bookings start on a grid of this many minutes from opening time |
| `reservation_duration_minutes` | Restaurant | How long every reservation occupies its table |
| `cancellation_cutoff_minutes` | Restaurant | A booking cannot be cancelled or changed within this many minutes of its start |
| `opening_hours` | Restaurant | Per weekday. A day with no entry is closed |
| `capacity` | Table | Maximum party size |

### Fixture format

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": "u_ada", "email": "ada@example.com",
      "password": "correct horse", "display_name": "Ada" }
  ],
  "restaurants": [
    {
      "id": "r_anker",
      "name": "Zum Anker",
      "timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
      "slot_minutes": 30,
      "reservation_duration_minutes": 90,
      "cancellation_cutoff_minutes": 120,
      "opening_hours": [
        { "weekday": "thu", "opens": "18:00", "closes": "23:00" },
        { "weekday": "fri", "opens": "18:00", "closes": "23:30" }
      ],
      "tables": [
        { "id": "t_1", "label": "1", "capacity": 2 },
        { "id": "t_2", "label": "2", "capacity": 4 }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "reservations": []
}
```

- `weekday` is one of `mon tue wed thu fri sat sun`.
- `opens` and `closes` are local `HH:MM`, 24-hour. `closes` is always later than `opens` on the
  same local day — opening hours never cross midnight.
- Seeded users must be able to log in with the given password immediately.
- `reservations` may seed confirmed bookings, with the same fields as a `POST /reservations`
  body plus `id`, `reference` and `user_id`.

Fixtures may use any calendar date. A booking must not be rejected solely because its
start is in the past; the cancellation and amendment cutoff rules still apply.

## 5. Errors

Every 4xx and 5xx response carries this body:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "table_unavailable", "message": "human readable, any wording" } }
```

Use the specified HTTP status and `code`. The human-readable `message` may use any wording.
Endpoint-specific errors are listed with each endpoint.

| Status | `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `malformed_request` | Unparseable body, or a field of the wrong JSON type |
| 400 | `missing_idempotency_key` | Required `Idempotency-Key` header absent or empty |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Missing, malformed or unknown bearer token |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Authenticated, but not permitted to touch this resource |
| 404 | `not_found` | No such resource, or not visible to this caller |
| 409 | `idempotency_key_reuse` | Key already used by this caller with a different request body |
| 422 | `validation_failed` | A required field or query parameter is missing, or a stated rule is violated with no more specific code |

A field of the correct JSON type with an invalid format or out-of-range value gives
422 `validation_failed`, unless an endpoint specifies a different error. This includes
invalid dates, negative counts and values exceeding a stated maximum or length. In addition:

- Endpoint-specific field rules take precedence: invalid `party_size` values (including strings
  and booleans) and `starts_at_local` strings that are not a bare local `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` are
  422 `validation_failed`. Other wrong JSON types follow the rule below.
- An integer-valued **query parameter** is written as plain decimal digits: `1e9`, `4.0` and `+4`
  are 422 `validation_failed` whatever their numeric value.
- Reserve 400 `malformed_request` for a body that does not parse or a field of the wrong type.

Shared ranges, enforced on every endpoint that takes them:

| Field | Valid | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `Idempotency-Key` | 1 to 255 characters | 422 `validation_failed` |

Requests must not produce 5xx responses, including under concurrent load.

## 6. Authentication

Authentication supports signup and login. Email verification, password reset, refresh
tokens and role-management endpoints are out of scope. Permissions specified elsewhere
in these requirements still apply.

```http
POST /auth/signup
{ "email": "a@example.com", "password": "correct horse", "display_name": "Ada" }

->  201  { "user_id": "u_1", "display_name": "Ada", "token": "..." }
```

```http
POST /auth/login
{ "email": "a@example.com", "password": "correct horse" }

->  200  { "user_id": "u_1", "display_name": "Ada", "token": "..." }
```

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| Email already registered | 409 `email_taken` |
| Password shorter than 8 characters | 422 `validation_failed` |
| `email` not of the form `local@domain` | 422 `validation_failed` |
| Wrong password or unknown email on login | 401 `unauthenticated` |

Every other endpoint requires a bearer token, except `/health`, `/_test/reset`, the two above, and
the three public endpoints named at the top of §8 — `GET /restaurants`, `GET /restaurants/{id}` and
`GET /availability`:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Tokens do not expire. An account may have multiple valid tokens and concurrent sessions.

Passwords must be stored using a password-hashing function such as bcrypt, scrypt or
Argon2, or an equivalent. Plaintext password storage is not permitted.
