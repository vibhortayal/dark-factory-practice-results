## 7. Idempotency

Two write paths require an idempotency key: **`POST /reservations`** (§8) and
**`POST /reservation-moves`** (§11).

```http
Idempotency-Key: <client-chosen string, 1..255 characters>
```

The key is scoped to **the authenticated user**. Two different users may use the same key string
with no interaction between them.

A replay means the same user sending the **same method, the same path and the same body**. The
same key with the same body on a different path is a different request, not a replay, and must
succeed normally.

After the body has been parsed as a JSON object and the caller authenticated, idempotency
is resolved before endpoint-specific field validation or current-resource checks. Thus a
used key with a different JSON body returns `409 idempotency_key_reuse` even when that new
body would otherwise be invalid.

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| Header absent or empty | 400 `missing_idempotency_key` |
| First use of the key | The normal response, **201** |
| Replay: same key, same body | **200**, body identical to the original response as a JSON value |
| Same key, different body | 409 `idempotency_key_reuse` |
| Key reused after the original request failed with 4xx | Treated as a first use |

"Same body" means the same JSON value after parsing — key order and whitespace do not matter.

For concurrent identical requests with an unused key, exactly one returns 201.
The others return 200 with the same body. The operation takes effect only once.

A successful replay returns the original response, even after the resource changes or
is cancelled. It makes no further state changes.

## 8. API

`GET /restaurants`, `GET /restaurants/{id}` and `GET /availability` are **public** — no bearer
token. Everything else needs one. Diners browse before they sign in.

### `GET /restaurants`

```json
{ "restaurants": [ { "id": "r_anker", "name": "Zum Anker", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin" } ] }
```

### `GET /restaurants/{id}`

The restaurant with its `slot_minutes`, `reservation_duration_minutes`,
`cancellation_cutoff_minutes`, `opening_hours` and `tables`, in the fixture's shape. 404 if
unknown.

### `GET /availability`

```http
GET /availability?restaurant_id=r_anker&date=2026-09-24&party_size=4
```

All three parameters are required; a missing one is 422 `validation_failed`. `date` is a local
calendar date at the restaurant.

```json
{
  "restaurant_id": "r_anker",
  "date": "2026-09-24",
  "timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
  "slots": [
    { "starts_at_local": "2026-09-24T18:00",
      "starts_at": "2026-09-24T18:00:00+02:00",
      "available_table_ids": ["t_2"] }
  ]
}
```

`starts_at_local` is the full `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` and goes into `POST /reservations` unchanged.

A slot appears for every `slot_minutes` step from `opens` such that
`slot + reservation_duration_minutes <= closes`. `available_table_ids` lists the tables of that
restaurant with `capacity >= party_size` and no overlapping confirmed reservation, in fixture
order. A slot with no available table still appears, with an empty list.

A closed day returns `"slots": []`.

### `POST /reservations`

`Idempotency-Key` is required; see §7.

```http
POST /reservations
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Idempotency-Key: 2f9c1a...

{ "restaurant_id": "r_anker", "table_id": "t_2",
  "starts_at_local": "2026-09-24T19:00", "party_size": 4 }
```

`starts_at_local` is wall-clock at the restaurant, with no offset and no `Z`. Resolve it against
the restaurant's `timezone`.

```json
201
{
  "reservation_id": "res_7",
  "reference": "K3P7QW",
  "restaurant_id": "r_anker",
  "table_id": "t_2",
  "party_size": 4,
  "status": "confirmed",
  "starts_at_local": "2026-09-24T19:00",
  "starts_at": "2026-09-24T19:00:00+02:00",
  "ends_at": "2026-09-24T20:30:00+02:00",
  "created_at": "2026-09-21T11:04:03+00:00"
}
```

`reference` is 6 to 12 characters of `A-Z0-9`, unique across all reservations, and never changes.

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| The table is taken for an overlapping interval | 409 `table_unavailable` |
| `starts_at_local` is not on the slot grid | 422 `not_on_slot_grid` |
| Slot outside opening hours, or the reservation would end after `closes` | 422 `outside_opening_hours` |
| `party_size` exceeds the table's `capacity` | 422 `party_exceeds_capacity` |
| `party_size` below 1, or not an integer | 422 `validation_failed` |
| `starts_at_local` is a local time that does not exist (see §9) | 422 `invalid_local_time` |
| Unknown restaurant, unknown table, or the table belongs to another restaurant | 404 `not_found` |

### `GET /reservations`

The caller's reservations, `starts_at` descending, confirmed and cancelled alike.
Return `200` with `{"reservations": [...]}`; each entry has the same shape as the
create response. An empty list is `{"reservations": []}`.

### `GET /reservations/{reference}`

One reservation. **404 if it is not the caller's** — do not leak the existence of other people's
bookings.

### `POST /reservations/{reference}/cancel`

```json
200
{ "reference": "K3P7QW", "status": "cancelled", ... }
```

Frees the table immediately: the next `GET /availability` must offer that slot again.

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| Already cancelled | 200 with the current state — cancelling twice is not an error |
| Now is within `cancellation_cutoff_minutes` of `starts_at`, or later | 409 `cutoff_passed` |
| Not the caller's reservation | 404 `not_found` |

### `PATCH /reservations/{reference}`

Change the time, the table or the party size. Any subset of `table_id`, `starts_at_local`,
`party_size`. No idempotency key is required here.

Validation is identical to `POST /reservations`, and the same cutoff rule as cancel applies
(409 `cutoff_passed`), measured against the **current** start time. A cancelled reservation is
409 `reservation_cancelled`. A successful amendment releases the old slot and reserves the
new one together. A failed amendment leaves the original booking and its occupancy unchanged.

`reference` and `reservation_id` survive a change.

## 9. Time and DST

Local dates and times follow the restaurant's `timezone`, including daylight-saving transitions.

**Spring forward.** Local times in the skipped hour do not exist. They never appear in
availability, and booking one is 422 `invalid_local_time`.

**Fall back.** Local times in the repeated hour occur twice. **Always resolve to the first
occurrence — the one before the clocks change.** The slot appears once in availability, and the
second occurrence is not bookable.

`reservation_duration_minutes` is **absolute time**, not wall-clock. A 90-minute reservation
starting at 01:30 on a fall-back night ends 90 real minutes later, and its local `ends_at` will
read 02:00, not 03:00.

The transitions that must be handled:

| Zone | Spring forward | Fall back |
|---|---|---|
| `Europe/Berlin` | 2026-03-29, 02:00 → 03:00 | 2026-10-25, 03:00 → 02:00 |
| `America/New_York` | 2026-03-08, 02:00 → 03:00 | 2026-11-01, 02:00 → 01:00 |

Offsets must follow the IANA rules for the specified zone and date.

## 10. Export and import

The service must support `GET /_test/export` and `POST /_test/import`. Like reset, these
are unauthenticated test endpoints.
Exports may contain credentials and session tokens; handle them as private test artifacts.
Return 200 from export with a JSON object containing `track: "tablekeeper"`,
`format_version: 1` and `state` (an implementation-defined JSON object). The state format
is opaque to the caller and must be accepted unchanged by import.

Import takes that entire object and atomically replaces the service's state, returning
204. It must accept an unchanged export produced by this service. No dependency on the
source process, files, volume, port or network address is allowed. Import is replacement,
not merge; repeating it restores the exported state without duplicating anything. Invalid
JSON follows §5; missing fields, wrong track/version or an invalid state give 422
`validation_failed` without changing the destination. Test control calls have a 10-second
timeout. Export is an atomic, read-only snapshot; subsequent source writes do not change it.

Preserve accounts and hashed-password login, existing bearer tokens, fixture configuration,
reservations, references, all completed idempotent request bodies and original responses.
Identities, statuses and timestamps must not be regenerated. Failed request keys remain
reusable. Existing receipts, references, tokens and retries must remain valid after import;
replacing the state with a fresh fixture does not satisfy this requirement. Import removes
all previous destination data and credentials. Reset continues to clear all state, including
imported state. State need not survive an abrupt container restart.

## 11. Atomic reservation moves

A diner may change several bookings in one request.

`POST /reservation-moves` requires authentication and an idempotency key. Body:

```json
{"moves": [{"reference": "BOOK01", "table_id": "t_2"},
           {"reference": "BOOK02", "table_id": "t_1"}]}
```

`moves` contains 1..8 objects with distinct string references. Invalid shape or duplicate
references gives 422 `validation_failed`. Every booking must belong to the caller and the
same restaurant. Unknown/another owner's reference gives 404 `not_found`; different
restaurants give 422 `validation_failed`. No token gives 401.

Each item accepts the ordinary PATCH fields `table_id`, `starts_at_local`, `party_size`;
omitted fields retain their current values and unknown fields are ignored. The booking's
identity, owner and creation time never change. Cancelled bookings give 409
`reservation_cancelled`. Each booking's existing cutoff applies. Non-occupancy errors use
ordinary amendment codes and take precedence in input order, with cutoff errors preceding
other changes for that booking. An overlap among resulting bookings or with an unlisted
booking gives 409 `table_unavailable`. Unchanged listed bookings retain their occupancy.

Either every move commits or nothing changes: occupancy, reservation records and retry
keys. On success return 201 with `{"reservations": [...]}` in input order, including
unchanged items.
Replays return that original response with 200, even after amendments or cancellations.
No-op moves retain all existing values. Export/import preserves successful batch receipts
as well as the resulting bookings. No batch UI is required.
