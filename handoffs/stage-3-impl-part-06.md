STAGE-3 HANDOFF PART 6/12 — SPECIFICATION stage-2.md (verbatim, still in force)

`amount` is optional and defaults to the authorisation's remaining amount. As on
`POST /requests/{id}/pay`, **a replay must send the identical body** — `{}` and `{"amount": 2000}`
are different JSON values even when they mean the same capture, so reusing a key across the two is
409 `idempotency_key_reuse` per `stage-1.md` §7.

Returns `201` with the created **payment**, in exactly the shape `POST /payments` returns, with
`authorization_id` set to this authorisation and `request_id: null`. The payment's `amount` is the
captured amount; its `note` and `visibility` are copied from the authorisation; it appears in the
activity feed by the ordinary visibility rule. Payments created without an authorisation
carry `authorization_id: null`; their existing `request_id` semantics are unchanged.

By default the authorisation becomes `captured`, carries `captured_amount` and `payment_id`, and **releases the
uncaptured remainder immediately**: capturing 1500 of 2000 returns 500 to the payer's `available` in
the same step.

**Default: one final capture per authorisation.** A second capture after a final capture is
`409 authorization_not_open`.

**Extended capture mode.** To keep the remainder held, send `{"amount": 700, "final": false}`.
`final` is boolean, default `true`, so earlier single-capture requests retain their behavior.
With `final: false` and an uncaptured remainder, status stays `open`; further captures are
allowed up to that remainder. Capturing the entire remainder closes it even with `final: false`.
A final capture closes it and releases any remainder. `capture_exceeds_authorization` compares
with the **remaining** amount; omitted amount defaults to that remainder. `captured_amount` is
cumulative; `payment_id` is the latest capture; `payment_ids` lists every capture in order.
Every authorization response adds `remaining_amount`: the amount still held, zero when closed.
Void and expiry can close a partially captured authorization, release only the remainder,
and preserve all capture records. New fields do not change idempotency body equality.

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| The authorisation is not `open` | 409 `authorization_not_open` |
| `expires_at` is at or before now | 409 `authorization_expired` |
| `amount` above the authorisation's uncaptured remainder | 422 `capture_exceeds_authorization` |
| `amount` below 1, or not an integer | 422 `validation_failed` |
| The caller is not the receiver | 403 `forbidden` |
| Unknown authorisation | 404 `not_found` |

### `POST /authorizations/{id}/void`

**Only the payer may void** — the `from` party releasing their own hold. No idempotency key, like
decline and cancel.

`200` with the authorisation, `status: "voided"`, the hold released. Voiding an already-voided
authorisation is `200` with the current state. A `captured` or `expired` one is
`409 authorization_not_open`.

For an existing authorization, capture and void return 403 `forbidden` when the caller
is not the permitted party, including callers who are neither party. `GET /authorizations`
returns only authorizations involving the caller.

### `GET /authorizations`

```http
GET /authorizations?direction=outgoing&status=open&limit=50&offset=0
```

Authorisations where the caller is the payer or the receiver, and no others. Newest first by
`created_at`.

- `direction` is `outgoing` (the caller is the payer), `incoming` (the caller is the receiver), or
  absent for both.
- `status` is one of the four statuses, or absent for all. An authorisation expired by the clock
  matches `expired`, never `open`.
- `limit`, `offset` and `has_more` behave exactly as on `GET /requests`.

## UI

A new route `/authorizations`, and the wallet gains two numbers. The UI and the API share
`/authorizations`: serve HTML for `Accept: text/html` and JSON otherwise, as for `/requests`.

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `wallet-balance` | Formatted `total`, retaining the existing display and `data-amount` |
| `wallet-available` | Formatted `available`, with `data-amount`. **Present this as the headline number** — it is what the user can actually spend |
| `wallet-held` | Formatted `held`, with `data-amount`. Absent when `held` is zero |
| `authorize-handle`, `authorize-amount`, `authorize-note`, `authorize-visibility`, `authorize-submit` | The authorise form. Same input rules as the pay form |
| `authorize-error` | Shown when the authorisation is refused, including insufficient available funds |
| `authorization-list` | Container on `/authorizations`. Children newest first in the DOM |
| `authorization-item-{authorization_id}` | Carries `data-status="{status}"` |
| `authorization-amount-{id}` | Text is exactly the formatted authorised amount |
| `authorization-captured-{id}` | Formatted captured amount. Present only when `status` is `captured` |
| `authorization-expires-{id}` | Text is the RFC 3339 `expires_at` |
| `authorization-capture-amount-{id}` | Decimal input, pre-filled with the remaining amount. Present only on an incoming `open` authorisation |
| `authorization-capture-{id}` | Button. Present only on an incoming `open` authorisation |
| `authorization-void-{id}` | Button. Present only on an outgoing `open` authorisation |
| `authorization-error` | Shown when a capture or a void is refused |
| `empty-authorizations` | Shown when the list is empty |

The UI must reflect seeded and newly created holds. Show available funds as the user's
spending balance, including immediately after reset with open holds.

## Concurrent operations

Concurrent requests must produce the same results as executing them one at a time in some
order, and the requirements above hold at every read.
