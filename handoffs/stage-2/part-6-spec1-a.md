@vibhor15/nightshift-implementer STAGE 2 HANDOFF — part 6 of 9: specification stage-1.md, sections 1–6 (verbatim; still applies to stage 2). Do not start until part 9 (FINAL).

# Pocketful — Stage 1: payments and settlements

This stage defines the initial service and its API.

Build from the supplied requirements. Source code, API documentation and schemas from
existing products in this domain must not be used.

## 1. Scope

Users can send money by handle, request money and split bills. Payments appear in an
activity feed with public or private visibility. Authorized operators can submit groups
of transfers as settlements. Only the HTTP API is required.

The following apply to all operations, including concurrent requests and retries:

1. The sum of wallet balances always equals the total seeded by the last `POST /_test/reset`.
2. No wallet balance may be negative, including transiently.
3. A payment request may move money at most once.

All amounts are exact integer counts of minor units. Deposits, top-ups, withdrawals,
cards and bank integrations are out of scope. Money moves only between existing wallets.

## 2. Delivery and deployment

Deliver an HTTP service, a `Dockerfile` and a `RUN.md` with a command that builds and
starts the service without manual setup. Language, framework and storage are unrestricted.
A `docker-compose.yml` is optional.

The submission is a containerized HTTP service, not a Python package. Python is not
required in the implementation. TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Python and any
other language are equally valid. The harness builds the submitted `Dockerfile`, starts
the resulting image and tests only its HTTP behavior; it does not import or execute the
submission's source files on the judge host.

The image must run on its own with `-e PORT=<port>` and a port mapping. Runtime networking
has no outbound access. All runtime dependencies, initialization and seed data must work
within that single container. Compose configuration is not used to start the service.

### Resource limits

The service must operate within these limits:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| CPU | 2 vCPU |
| Memory | 2 GiB |
| Start to first healthy response | 60 s |
| Concurrent requests | up to 50 in flight |
| Per-request timeout | 5 s (10 s for `POST /_test/reset`) |
| Outbound network | available during `docker build`, **none at run time** |
| Disk | ephemeral; state need not survive a container restart |

Runtime assets and dependencies must be included in the image. This includes fonts,
scripts and stylesheets; external services are unavailable at runtime.

## 3. Runtime contract

### 3.1 Listening

Listen on `0.0.0.0` using the `PORT` environment variable, default `8080`.

### 3.2 Health

```http
GET /health  ->  200  {"status": "ok"}
```

Return 200 once the service and its data store can serve requests, within 60 seconds
of container start. Non-200 responses are permitted before the service is ready.

### 3.3 Reset and seed

```http
POST /_test/reset
Content-Type: application/json

{ ...fixture... }

->  204 No Content
```

Replace all service state with the fixture in the request body (§4). When reset returns
204, subsequent requests must see only that fixture. Repeated resets are supported.
This test endpoint must be enabled in the delivered image and requires no authentication.

### 3.4 Conventions

- Requests and responses are `application/json; charset=utf-8`.
- Timestamps in responses are RFC 3339 with an explicit offset, e.g. `2026-09-24T19:00:00+02:00`.
- Unknown fields in a request body are ignored, never an error.
- Unknown query parameters are ignored.
- IDs are opaque strings of at most 64 characters. Their format is yours.

## 4. Model

The service has **one currency**, declared in the fixture. Every amount in the API is an integer
count of its minor units: `1000` in a `minor_units: 2` service is €10.00, and `1000` in a
`minor_units: 0` service is ¥1000.

API amounts must have an integral numeric value: JSON `1000`, `1000.0` and `1e3` all represent the
same valid minor-unit amount. Booleans and strings are not numbers here.

### Users and handles

Every user has a **handle**: unique across the service, matching `^[a-z0-9_]{1,20}$`, and never
changing once set. Users identify recipients by handle. Directory and user-search
endpoints are out of scope.

Seeded users take their handle from the fixture. A user created through `POST /auth/signup`
(§6 — there is no `handle` field in the signup body) has one **derived** from their email: take the
local part, lowercase it, replace every character outside `[a-z0-9_]` with `_`, and truncate to 20
characters. If that handle is already taken the signup fails; see the signup table in §6.

New users start with a balance of `0`. They can receive money and be asked for money immediately.

### Payments and requests

A **payment** moves money from one wallet to another, immediately and atomically. It is either sent
directly or created by paying a request.

A **request** asks someone for money. The `requester` will receive; the `payer` is being asked. A
request is `pending`, and then exactly one of `paid`, `declined` or `cancelled`. Only the payer may
pay or decline it; only the requester may cancel it.

**A request may exceed the payer's balance.** That is a legal state, not an error at creation time:
the request stays `pending` until it is paid, declined or cancelled, and an attempt to pay it while
short is `409 insufficient_funds` and changes nothing. Money can arrive later and the same request
then becomes payable.

**Visibility belongs to the payment, not the request.** The payer chooses it when the money moves.
A request carries no visibility of its own and never appears in anyone else's feed.

### The feed contract

`GET /activity` returns payments only. A payment appears for a caller **if and only if** its
`visibility` is `public`, **or** the caller is its sender or its receiver. There is no other rule,
no follow graph and no mute list. Requests never appear in the activity feed; they are read through
`GET /requests`, which returns only requests where the caller is the requester or the payer.

A split is not a feed item. The requests it creates are visible to their own two parties, and the
payments that eventually fulfil them follow the rule above.

Visibility is **one value on the payment**, seen identically by both parties and by everyone else.
A `private` payment is hidden from third parties, not from its own receiver.

### Arithmetic range

`amount` is at most `1000000000` on any single request, and no operation produces a balance outside
±2⁵³. Monetary arithmetic must preserve exact minor-unit values without rounding error.

### Fixture format

```json
{
  "currency": "EUR",
  "minor_units": 2,
  "users": [
    { "id": "u_ada", "email": "ada@example.com", "password": "correct horse",
      "display_name": "Ada", "handle": "ada", "balance": 10000 },
    { "id": "u_bob", "email": "bob@example.com", "password": "correct horse",
      "display_name": "Bob", "handle": "bob", "balance": 2500 }
  ],
  "payments": [
    { "id": "p_1", "from_user_id": "u_ada", "to_user_id": "u_bob",
      "amount": 500, "note": "coffee", "visibility": "public" }
  ],
  "requests": [
    { "id": "rq_1", "requester_id": "u_bob", "payer_id": "u_ada",
      "amount": 1200, "note": "taxi", "status": "pending" }
  ]
}
```

- Seeded users must be able to log in with the given password immediately.
- `balance` is the wallet balance **after** every seeded payment has been applied. Seeded
  numbers are consistent; you do not replay seeded payments against balances.
- A `balance` below zero in a fixture is a reset error: return `422 validation_failed` from
  `POST /_test/reset` and change nothing.
- `minor_units` is `0`, `2` or `3`. Fixtures use `EUR` (2), `JPY` (0) and `BHD` (3).

An administrative balance endpoint is out of scope.

## 5. Errors

Every 4xx and 5xx response carries this body:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "insufficient_funds", "message": "human readable, any wording" } }
```

Use the specified HTTP status and `code`. The human-readable `message` may use any wording.
Endpoint-specific errors are listed with each endpoint.

| Status | `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `malformed_request` | Unparseable body, or a field of the wrong JSON type |
| 400 | `missing_idempotency_key` | Required `Idempotency-Key` header absent or empty |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Missing, malformed or unknown bearer token |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Authenticated, but not permitted to touch this resource |
| 404 | `not_found` | No such resource, or not visible to this caller |
| 409 | `idempotency_key_reuse` | Key already used by this caller with a different request body |
| 422 | `validation_failed` | A required field or query parameter is missing, or a stated rule is violated with no more specific code |

A field of the correct JSON type with an invalid format or out-of-range value gives
422 `validation_failed`, unless an endpoint specifies a different error. This includes
invalid dates, negative counts and values exceeding a stated maximum or length. In addition:

- Endpoint-specific field rules take precedence: invalid `amount` values (including strings and
  booleans), non-string `note` values (including `null`), and any `visibility` other than
  `public` or `private` are 422 `validation_failed`. Omission alone selects the optional-field
  defaults. Other wrong JSON types follow the rule below.
- An integer-valued **query parameter** is written as plain decimal digits: `1e9`, `4.0` and `+4`
  are 422 `validation_failed` whatever their numeric value.
- Reserve 400 `malformed_request` for a body that does not parse or a field of the wrong type.

Shared ranges, enforced on every endpoint that takes them:

| Field | Valid | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `Idempotency-Key` | 1 to 255 characters | 422 `validation_failed` |
| `limit` | integer 1 to 200 | 422 `validation_failed` |
| `offset` | integer 0 or more | 422 `validation_failed` |

Requests must not produce 5xx responses, including under concurrent load.

## 6. Authentication

Authentication supports signup and login. Email verification, password reset, refresh
tokens and role-management endpoints are out of scope. Permissions specified elsewhere
in these requirements still apply.

```http
POST /auth/signup
{ "email": "a@example.com", "password": "correct horse", "display_name": "Ada" }

->  201  { "user_id": "u_1", "display_name": "Ada", "token": "..." }
```

```http
POST /auth/login
{ "email": "a@example.com", "password": "correct horse" }

->  200  { "user_id": "u_1", "display_name": "Ada", "token": "..." }
```

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| Email already registered | 409 `email_taken` |
| Password shorter than 8 characters | 422 `validation_failed` |
| `email` not of the form `local@domain` | 422 `validation_failed` |
| Wrong password or unknown email on login | 401 `unauthenticated` |
| The handle derived from the email (§4) is already taken | 409 `handle_taken`, and no account is created |

Every other endpoint requires a bearer token, except `/health`, `/_test/reset` and the two above.
Wallet API endpoints require authentication.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Tokens do not expire. An account may have multiple valid tokens and concurrent sessions.

Passwords must be stored using a password-hashing function such as bcrypt, scrypt or
Argon2, or an equivalent. Plaintext password storage is not permitted.
